### Loading Funds Via Invoice (ACH/Wire)

Best practice is to load funds via EFT whenever feasible, as it avoids any surcharges. When adding funds this way, an invoice will be generated which will have all the information needed to send the EFT successfully.

Once your funds arrive, they will be credited to your account so you can start ordering. The time it takes for the EFT to arrive generally depends on your bank; some banks can get them sent the same business day while others may take several business days to process the transfer.

You can save yourself a step by sending the invoice to your accounts payable team directly through the portal.&#x20;

### Loading Funds Via Credit Card

If you need to send out cards in a hurry, adding funds via credit card is a great option. Simply select Credit Card as your payment method and enter your card of choice.&#x20;

There is a 3% surcharge applied to credit card transactions
